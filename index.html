           <h2>About</h2>
           <p>Employed as the Public Information Officer for the Squaxin Island Tribe, I have the unique opportunity to participate in numerous and varied tribal communications projects.  One of the most interesting was promotion of the <em>Paddle to Squaxin, Canoe Journey 2012. </em> Approximately 30,000 people attended from all across the Pacific Northwest.  Communications activities included development of a <a href="http://paddletosquaxin.org" target="_blank">website </a>and numerous printed materials, including maps, and travel guides, etc.       </p>
